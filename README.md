# learn_python
This repository is where I document my progress as I learn Python — from the very basics like printing “Hello, World!” to building more advanced projects, including couple capstone projects.

Each folder in this repo shows what I’ve learned. I’ve included projects I have done to help me review what I’ve done. This helps me stay organized and track how much I’ve improved over time.

The goal is to eventually gets hands on experience on coding and be able to build any project that I'm interested in  — something bigger and more complete.

This repo is just my learning space, and I’ll keep updating it as I go. Feel free to look around!
